  - "Hmmm\u2026 Notes and bills\u2026 The De Valborgne family seems to own both the
    water network and the quarry and freely distribute their services to the village.
    No wonder they can do whatever they want with it!\r"
  - "Letters? From a \u2026 High priest? \u201CThe feast is almost ready.\u201D They
    do not want anyone lurking around. That explains why those guys want to stop me.
    Or maybe kill me. What are they? Cultists? From what cult?"
