  Dialog:
  - Great, I must be in the quarry area of the manor. The De Valborgne started to
    dig it to build their mansion. Gosh, there is a lot of clay coming out of there!
    And they are only selling less than half of it?
  - "Bills again. \u201CFamily employee since 1598.\u201D They used to pay a lot of
    people. But now there is only one person left? G. Ruik. I wonder if it is a descendent
    from that G. Ruik they hired when they arrived."
  - "\u201CA new girl is born.\u201D They seem to maintain a pretty nice record of
    the village birth rate. And the phase of the moon they are born into. Some of
    them have arrows. So does the little Emilie, who has been missing for 2 days."
