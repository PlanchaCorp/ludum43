  Dialog:
  - "This seems to be the desk of a High Priest. Interesting, there are just papers
    and commands. He is supposed to \u201Cdispose of the girl.\u201D So cultists are
    doing something with clay, water and girls."
  - "Ah! This is one of Ruik\u2019s assistants. He seems to have some power on the
    high priest. \u201CWe shall be prepared by November 30th. He will awake, he shall
    be starved.\u201D Those lines remind me something."
  - "Another assistant\u2019s desk. As I feared, the clay and the water are used to
    invoke a creature from another plane. Its name is not written anywhere. Just \u201CHe\u201D,
    \u201CHim.\u201D And what is this \u201CPond\u201D they are speaking about?"
