  - "There is a count of the cultist. Wow, that\u2019s a huge number. Where do they
    come from? Why is this the unique record I have about them?"
  - "Is it\u2026Yes! The name of the creature is Ch\u2019boulu. He grants unbelievable
    power to the ones invoking Him a devour the souls sacrificed to him. His body
    is made of clay and water, and the blood nourishes Him."
  - "Infinite power. At what cost? Oh. There is a number. The number of girls that
    have gone missing. Roughly the same as the one of cultist. Ch\u2019boulu is eating
    the soul of those poor girls, making them proper cultists."
  - "This is it. The final desk, the final proof. The amount of clay, the volume of
    water\u2026 the perfect recipe for the unholy monster. I am afraid Emilie has
    already been murdered. I need to go deeper, maybe I am the only one that have
    the power to make it stop?"
